[**Purpose and Scope**
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Employee Management System (EMS), a React-based web application designed for task management with role-based authentication. The EMS enables administrators to create and oversee tasks while providing employees with interfaces to view and manage their assigned work.

This overview covers the system's core architecture, key components, and data flow patterns. For detailed information about specific subsystems, see System Architecture, User Interfaces, and Task Management System. Development setup and configuration details are covered in Development Setup.

**System Description**
The EMS is a client-side React application built with Vite that implements a complete task management workflow. The system supports two distinct user roles - administrators and employees - each with tailored dashboard interfaces and capabilities. Authentication is handled through a custom login system with session persistence via localStorage.

**Application Architecture**
The application follows a component-based architecture with centralized state management through React Context. The main application flow is controlled by App.jsx, which serves as the authentication controller and routing hub.

Sources: ems/src/main.jsx 1-14 | ems/src/App.jsx 1-84

**Key Component Relationships**
The application uses a hierarchical component structure where App.jsx serves as the central orchestrator, managing authentication state and routing users to appropriate dashboard components based on their roles.

**State Management Architecture**
The application employs a dual-layer state management approach combining React Context for global state and local component state for UI-specific data. The AuthContext provides application-wide access to user and task data, while localStorage ensures session persistence across browser refreshes.

Data Persistence and State Flow

| Component            | State Responsibility                           | Persistence Method         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| AuthProvider         | Global user and task data                      | React Context              |
| App	                 | Authentication state (user, loggedInUserData)	| Local state + localStorage |
| localStorage         | Session persistence	                          | Browser storage            |
| Dashboard Components | UI-specific state                              | Local component state      |

The authentication flow in App.jsx demonstrates the integration between these layers:

1. Session Check: ems/src/App.jsx 21-29 checks localStorage for existing sessions
2. Login Handling: ems/src/App.jsx 32-58 validates credentials and updates both local state and localStorage
3. Role-Based Routing: ems/src/App.jsx 66-73 conditionally renders appropriate dashboard components

**Technology Stack**
The EMS is built using modern React development tools and follows standard React application patterns:

- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **Context API** for state management
- **localStorage** for client-side data persistence
- **Conditional rendering** for role-based UI display
  
The application entry point at ems/src/main.jsx 8-14 demonstrates the standard React 18 mounting pattern with StrictMode and the AuthProvider wrapper ensuring global state availability throughout the component tree.
